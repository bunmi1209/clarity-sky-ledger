# SkyLedger

A decentralized platform for tracking and trading aviation carbon credits on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

SkyLedger enables airlines and organizations to:
- Register flight carbon emissions
- Generate carbon credits
- Trade credits between participants
- Track credit ownership and history
- Retire carbon credits permanently
- Buy and sell credits through a marketplace

The platform uses fungible tokens to represent carbon credits, with 1 token equaling 1 metric ton of CO2 offset.

## Contract Functions

### Core Functions
- Register new carbon credits
- Transfer credits between parties
- View credit balances and history
- Verify credit authenticity

### New Market Features
- Create marketplace listings for credits
- Purchase credits from the marketplace
- Retire verified credits permanently
- Track total retired credits

### Market Listings
Users can create listings to sell their carbon credits at a specified price. Buyers can purchase these credits directly through the platform using STX tokens.

### Credit Retirement
Verified credits can be permanently retired, removing them from circulation. This represents the final use of the carbon offset and prevents double-counting of environmental benefits.

## Contract Integration
The platform now includes a comprehensive marketplace and retirement tracking system, making it a complete solution for carbon credit lifecycle management.
